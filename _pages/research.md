# Research

### Overview 
---
Our research focuses on drug discovery, medicinal chemistry,(generative) artificial intelligence, deep learning, chemoinformatics, and bioinformatics. Specifically, I apply deep learning methods and computational techniques to unlock drug R&D and health computing.





### Current Research Directions
---

#### AI-Driven Design and Screening of Protein–Protein Interaction Modulators

Proteins can function on their own, but they also perform specific functions through protein–protein interaction(PPIs) to perform specific functions. The molecular generation models for PPIs modulators are relatively lacking.






#### Physics-Guided Generative AI Integrated with Molecular Dynamics

Biology is a highly complex dynamical system. Capturing this complexity requires dynamic modeling approaches to better understand and predict the emergent properties of biological systems.
